## Project Overview
Building a Shopify-like e-commerce platform using Elixir, Phoenix with LiveView, and shadcn UI components. The platform will allow users to quickly open their own online stores with a global marketplace and support for custom domains. Each store is independently owned and operated by different merchants who maintain full control over their stores. Merchants can choose to host their stores on Dukkadee's infrastructure or on their own servers while still having the option to list their products on our global marketplace.

# Dukkadee Platform Specifications

## Platform Overview

Dukkadee is a dual-purpose e-commerce platform that serves as both:
1. A store creation application that enables merchants to quickly establish their online presence
2. A global marketplace that aggregates products from individual stores

## Store Ownership and Access Model

### Store Ownership
- Each store on the Dukkadee platform is **independently owned** by different merchants/store owners
- Store owners maintain **full access and control** over their individual stores
- Store owners have complete autonomy over their store's:
  - Products and inventory
  - Pricing and promotions
  - Store design and branding
  - Customer data
  - Order fulfillment processes
  - Payment processing options

### Marketplace Integration
- Store owners can **optionally** list their products on the Dukkadee global marketplace
- Participation in the marketplace is **not mandatory** for store owners
- Store owners can select which products to list on the marketplace and which to keep exclusive to their store
- Marketplace listings provide additional visibility and sales opportunities
- Store owners maintain control over their marketplace listings and can remove them at any time

## Hosting Options

Dukkadee provides flexible hosting options to accommodate different merchant needs:

### 1. Dukkadee-Hosted Solution (Default)
- Stores are hosted on Dukkadee's infrastructure
- Fully managed hosting with automatic updates and maintenance
- Integrated with all Dukkadee platform features
- Custom domain support (e.g., yourstore.com or store.dukkadee.com)
- Simplified setup process with minimal technical requirements
- Includes security, backups, and performance optimization

### 2. Self-Hosted Solution
- Store owners can host their store on their own servers/infrastructure
- Full control over hosting environment and server configuration
- API-based integration with the Dukkadee marketplace (optional)
- Synchronization mechanisms for inventory and orders
- Support for various deployment options:
  - Docker containers
  - Traditional web hosting
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- Technical documentation and deployment guides provided

## Data Ownership and Privacy

- Store owners **own all their store data**
- Customer data belongs to the respective store owner, not Dukkadee
- Dukkadee acts as a data processor, not a data controller for store-specific data
- Clear data segregation between stores to ensure privacy and security
- Data portability allows store owners to export their data at any time

## Technical Architecture for Dual Hosting

### API-First Approach
- RESTful and GraphQL APIs for all core functionality
- Webhook system for real-time event notifications
- Authentication and authorization system with store-specific access controls

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- Real-time or scheduled synchronization between self-hosted stores and the marketplace
- Conflict resolution strategies for inventory and pricing updates
- Offline capabilities with reconciliation upon reconnection

### Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- Role-based access control for store management
- API key management and rotation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core platform with Dukkadee-hosted solution
2. Marketplace integration for hosted stores
3. API development for external integration
4. Self-hosting capabilities and documentation
5. Advanced synchronization features

## Future Extensibility

- Headless commerce capabilities
- Integration with third-party e-commerce platforms
- Mobile app support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- AI-powered recommendations and personalization
