# Dukkadee Documentation Structure

## Current Documentation Files

We currently have several documentation files spread across the project:

1. **README.md** 
   - High-level project overview
   - Installation and setup instructions
   - Basic features list
   
2. **project_tracker.md** 
   - Project status and progress tracking
   - Detailed feature list
   - Development roadmap
   
3. **DOCS/development_rules.md**
   - Detailed project requirements
   - Technical guidelines
   - Implementation rules
   
4. **DOCS/legacy_store_import.md**
   - Specific documentation for the store import feature
   - Technical implementation details
   
5. **DOCS/project_specifications.md**
   - Detailed platform specifications
   - Store ownership and hosting model
   - Technical architecture
   
6. **DOCS/technology_roadmap.md**
   - Future technology plans
   - API strategy
   - Platform evolution

## Recommended Documentation Structure

To better organize our documentation, I recommend the following structure:

### 1. Keep as-is:

- **README.md** 
  - Maintain as the entry point for developers
  - Focus on quick start and installation
  - Link to other documentation

### 2. Consolidate these files:

- **DOCS/project_specifications.md** and **project_tracker.md**
  - Merge into a single **DOCS/project_overview.md**
  - Move project_tracker.md from root to DOCS folder
  - Organize with clear sections for specifications and current status

### 3. Maintain as specialized documents:

- **DOCS/development_rules.md**
  - Keep as the definitive guide for development standards
  
- **DOCS/technology_roadmap.md**
  - Maintain as a forward-looking document
  
- **DOCS/legacy_store_import.md**
  - Keep as feature-specific documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. Create new **DOCS/project_overview.md** that combines:
   - Core platform specifications from project_specifications.md
   - Project status and tracking from project_tracker.md
   
2. Update **README.md** to:
   - Keep it concise
   - Add links to all documentation files
   - Focus on getting started quickly

3. Maintain other specialized documents as-is but ensure cross-references

4. Consider adding a **DOCS/index.md** that serves as a documentation home page with links to all documents

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should exist in only one place
2. **Clear Organization**: Use consistent headers and structure
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Link between documents rather than duplicating information
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
5. **Version Control**: Document major changes in documentation files
