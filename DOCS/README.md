- **testing_guidelines.md**: Comprehensive testing standards and practices for the project.

- **deployment_guide.md**: Instructions for deploying the application in various environments.

## Project Rules

The project uses a `.cursorrules` file in the root directory that contains the development standards and guidelines. This file is used by the Cursor IDE to provide guidance during development.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following categories:

1. **Project Overview and Planning**
   - project_overview.md
   - technology_roadmap.md
   - project_status.md

2. **Development Guidelines**
   - development_standards.md
   - frontend_guidelines.md
   - testing_guidelines.md

## Future Modules

The project is designed to accommodate future expansion including:

1. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
   - Will be implemented as a separate context with clear boundaries
   - Will integrate with existing Stores and Products contexts
   - Planned features include customer management, communication history, and sales pipeline

2. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**
   - Will be implemented as a separate context with clear boundaries
   - Will integrate with existing product inventory and order management
   - Planned features include inventory management, supply chain tracking, and financial reporting

The current architecture is designed with these future modules in mind, ensuring that:
- Context boundaries are clearly defined
- Data models are extensible
- API endpoints follow consistent patterns
- Authentication and authorization systems can accommodate new roles and permissions

## Maintaining Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Focus on keeping the development_standards.md file up to date as the primary reference
2. Ensure consistency between the .cursorrules file and the documentation
3. Add new feature-specific documentation as needed
4. Update the README.md file if the documentation structure changes
