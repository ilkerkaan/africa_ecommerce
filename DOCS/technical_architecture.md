# Dukkadee Technical Architecture

## Overview

Dukkadee's technical architecture is designed to support both Dukkadee-hosted and self-hosted store solutions while maximizing performance, scalability, and flexibility. This document outlines the architectural decisions and implementation approaches.

## Initial Implementation: Direct In-App Architecture

For the Dukkadee-hosted solution, we are implementing a direct in-app architecture for maximum performance:

### Key Characteristics

1. **Monolithic Application Structure**
   - All store functionality within the same Elixir/Phoenix application
   - Logical separation through Phoenix contexts
   - Single codebase for easier development and deployment

2. **Performance Benefits**
   - No network overhead for internal communication
   - No serialization/deserialization costs
   - Shared resources (database connections, caches)
   - Function calls instead of HTTP requests
   - Response times measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds

3. **Real-time Capabilities**
   - Leveraging Elixir processes for concurrent operations
   - Phoenix PubSub for real-time event broadcasting
   - Phoenix Channels for WebSocket communication
   - LiveView for interactive UI without JavaScript complexity

4. **Data Flow**
   - Direct database access via Ecto
   - In-memory process communication
   - Efficient data sharing between components

## API Development (In Parallel)

While using a direct in-app approach for the hosted solution, we are developing APIs in parallel for specific use cases:

### API Purpose and Usage

1. **External Integration**
   - Self-hosted store synchronization
   - Third-party service integration
   - Mobile application support
   - Partner ecosystem development

2. **API Technologies**
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - GraphQL for flexible data querying
   - Webhook system for event notifications
   - Phoenix Channels for real-time communication

3. **API Design Principles**
   - Resource-oriented design
   - Consistent error handling
   - Proper versioning
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Authentication and authorization

4. **Important Note**: APIs are NOT used for internal communication within the Dukkadee-hosted solution to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.

## Architecture for Self-Hosted Stores

Self-hosted stores will use the API-based approach for integration with the Dukkadee platform:

1. **Deployment Options**
   - Docker containers
   - Traditional web hosting
   - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

2. **Synchronization**
   - Periodic data synchronization with the marketplace
   - Real-time event notifications for critical updates
   - Conflict resolution strategies

3. **Authentication and Security**
   - API key management
   - OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization
   - Rate limiting and request throttling
   - Data encryption in transit and at rest

## Data Architecture

1. **Multi-tenancy Approach**
   - Separate schemas for each store
   - Tenant identification through subdomains or custom domains
   - Isolated data storage with shared infrastructure

2. **Database Design**
   - PostgreSQL for relational data
   - Potential NoSQL solutions for specific use cases
   - Database sharding strategy for large-scale deployment

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Multi-level caching
   - Store-specific cache isolation
   - Cache invalidation through PubSub events

## Future Evolution

While starting with a monolithic architecture for performance, the system is designed with clear boundaries to allow for potential evolution:

1. **Potential Microservices Extraction**
   - Well-defined contexts can be extracted if needed
   - Event-driven communication between services
   - Gradual migration path without rewriting

2. **Scaling Strategy**
   - Horizontal scaling for web tier
   - Database read replicas for query scaling
   - Potential database sharding for write scaling
   - Caching layer expansion

## Performance Considerations

1. **Response Time Targets**
   - Page loads: < 500ms
   - API responses: < 100ms
   - Real-time updates: < 50ms

2. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Database query optimization
   - Efficient LiveView rendering
   - Strategic caching
   - Asset optimization
   - Background job processing

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Application performance
   - Database performance
   - User experience metrics
   - Business metrics

2. **Logging Strategy**
   - Structured logging
   - Context-aware log entries
   - Log aggregation and analysis

3. **Alerting**
   - Proactive monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Escalation procedures

## Conclusion

The direct in-app architecture for the Dukkadee-hosted solution provides maximum performance while the parallel development of APIs ensures flexibility for self-hosted stores and third-party integrations. This approach gives us the best of both worlds: speed and integration capabilities.
