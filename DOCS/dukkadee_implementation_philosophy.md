# Dukkadee Implementation Philosophy

Last updated: March 2, 2025

## Core Principles

The Dukkadee e-commerce platform follows these core implementation principles:

1. **Bounded Contexts**: Organize code around clear business domains with well-defined boundaries
2. **Component-First Design**: Use Phoenix's component system for consistent and reusable UI elements
3. **Performance Optimization**: Prioritize direct in-app architecture for maximum performance
4. **Future Extensibility**: Design with clear interfaces to allow future technology integration
5. **Secure by Default**: Embed security practices throughout the development process

## Architecture Patterns

### Phoenix Context Architecture

Dukkadee embraces Phoenix's context-based design approach:

1. **Clear Context Boundaries**
   - Each context represents a distinct business domain (Stores, Products, Appointments, etc.)
   - Contexts expose well-named public functions that clearly express intent
   - Keep implementation details private within contexts
   - Cross-context interactions happen through public interfaces, not internal details

2. **Context Organization**
   - `Dukkadee.Stores` - Store management and discovery
   - `Dukkadee.Products` - Product catalog and variants
   - `Dukkadee.Accounts` - User authentication and profiles
   - `Dukkadee.Appointments` - Scheduling and appointment management
   - `Dukkadee.StoreImporter` - Legacy store import functionality

3. **Schema Relationships**
   - Schemas belong to specific contexts
   - Cross-context relationships are managed through foreign keys
   - Complex multi-context operations use Ecto.Multi for transaction integrity

### Component-First UI Design

Following Phoenix 1.7's component architecture:

1. **Core Components**
   - Leverage `DukkadeeWeb.CoreComponents` for consistent UI elements
   - Implement business-specific components in appropriate domains
   - Use HEEx templates for HTML safety and component composition

2. **UI Organization**
   - Component libraries organized by domain and reusability
   - Store-specific theming built on component composition
   - Brand color system applied through tailwind and CSS variables

3. **LiveView Integration**
   - LiveView for interactive features (appointment booking, store customization)
   - LiveView components for real-time elements within traditional pages
   - Clear separation between LiveView state and context data

### Performance-First Architecture

As outlined in the technical architecture document:

1. **Direct In-App Architecture**
   - Monolithic application with logical context separation
   - Function calls instead of HTTP requests for internal operations
   - Single codebase for easier development and maintenance

2. **Data Access Optimization**
   - Strategic database query design to minimize roundtrips
   - Preloading related data to avoid N+1 query problems
   - Database indexes for frequently used queries

3. **Frontend Performance**
   - Smart caching strategies for store assets
   - Tailwind for efficient CSS delivery
   - Asset bundling and minimization

## Development Practices

### Code Organization and Naming

1. **Explicit Intent over Implementation Details**
   - Name functions to reflect their business purpose, not technical implementation
   - Example: `Stores.list_featured_stores()` instead of `Stores.get_stores_where_featured()`
   - Avoid leaking implementation details in public API names

2. **Consistent Pattern Application**
   - Follow Phoenix naming conventions consistently
   - Keep context function naming consistent across the application
   - Maintain predictable module organization

3. **Error Handling**
   - Return tagged tuples (`{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`) for operations that may fail
   - Validate data at context boundaries
   - Use proper error codes and messages for API responses

### Testing Strategy

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests for context functions and critical business logic
   - Controller/LiveView tests for web interfaces
   - Integration tests for cross-context workflows
   - End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

2. **Test Organization**
   - Mirror application structure in test organization
   - Use test factories for consistent test data
   - Focus on behavior testing over implementation testing

### Documentation

1. **Living Documentation**
   - Keep implementation philosophy updated as the application evolves
   - Document context boundaries and responsibilities
   - Maintain API documentation for external integrations

2. **Code Documentation**
   - Document public context functions with clear purpose and examples
   - Use typespecs for complex function signatures
   - Document schema fields with validation rules and business purpose

## Multi-Tenancy Approach

As an e-commerce platform hosting multiple independent stores:

1. **Store Isolation**
   - Each store has its own data namespace (products, appointments, etc.)
   - Cross-store operations are explicit and controlled
   - Design database schemas with store_id as a fundamental relationship

2. **Customization Strategy**
   - Implement store-specific theming through component composition
   - Store brand colors as database fields for dynamic application
   - Custom domains mapped through routing layer

3. **Shared Resources**
   - Global marketplace aggregates products across stores
   - Shared authentication system with store-specific permissions
   - Common payment processing infrastructure

## Migration and Evolution Strategy

1. **Schema Evolution**
   - Carefully designed migrations to prevent data corruption
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible
   - Use migration scripts for complex data transformations

2. **Feature Flag System**
   - Implement feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Allow per-store feature enablement
   - Test new features with limited audiences

3. **API Versioning**
   - Version external APIs for stability
   - Maintain backward compatibility in public interfaces
   - Document deprecation timelines

## Conclusion

This implementation philosophy guides Dukkadee's development toward a maintainable, performant, and extensible e-commerce platform. By following these principles, we ensure a consistent approach to code organization, feature development, and system evolution.

The philosophy should be reviewed and updated regularly as the platform evolves and as new Phoenix best practices emerge.
