# Dukkadee Technology Roadmap

## Current Technology Stack

### Core Platform (Current Phase)
- **Backend**: Elixir 1.18.2, Phoenix 1.7.7, Phoenix LiveView
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Ecto)
- **Authentication**: Phoenix built-in authentication
- **Real-time Features**: Phoenix Channels, LiveView
- **Asset Pipeline**: esbuild, Tailwind CLI

### Development Approach
- **Direct In-App Architecture** for the Dukkadee-hosted solution
  - All main functionality developed using Elixir and Phoenix
  - Monolithic architecture with context-based organization
  - Server-rendered UI with LiveView for interactive elements
  - Maximum performance with no network overhead
  - Shared resources and database connections
- **API Development in Parallel**
  - RESTful endpoints for external integration
  - APIs primarily for self-hosted stores and third-party integrations
  - Not used for internal communication in the hosted solution

## Future Technology Compatibility

### Phase 1: API First Approach (Q3 2025)
- Develop comprehensive REST API for all core functionality
- Implement GraphQL layer for flexible data querying
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Implement proper versioning strategy
- Add robust authentication and authorization for API access

### Phase 2: Headless Frontend Options (Q4 2025)
- Support for Next.js as alternative frontend
- Develop React component library matching current UI
- Create reference implementation of store frontend in Next.js
- Implement proper CORS and security measures
- Maintain both traditional and headless options

### Phase 3: Alternative E-commerce Backends (Q1 2026)
- Integration with Medusa.js for specialized e-commerce needs
- Support for Vendure for enterprise-level stores
- Compatibility with PHP-based solutions for legacy systems
- Develop synchronization mechanisms between systems
- Create migration tools between platforms

### Phase 4: Microservices Evolution (Q2 2026)
- Gradually refactor specific contexts into microservices
- Implement event-driven architecture for cross-service communication
- Develop service discovery and registry
- Implement distributed tracing and monitoring
- Create deployment pipelines for individual services

## API Strategy

### Design Principles
- **API First**: All features must have API endpoints before UI implementation
- **Consistency**: Follow consistent patterns across all endpoints
- **Versioning**: Proper versioning to ensure backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples
- **Security**: Robust authentication and authorization

### API Layers
1. **Core API (Elixir/Phoenix)**
   - RESTful endpoints for all core functionality
   - GraphQL for flexible querying
   - WebSockets for real-time features

2. **Integration Layer**
   - Adapters for third-party platforms
   - Webhooks for event notifications
   - OAuth for authentication with external services

3. **Client SDKs**
   - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
   - Mobile SDKs (future)
   - Server-side SDKs for PHP, Python, etc.

## Integration Points

### Store Frontend
- Headless API for custom frontends
- Theme API for customization
- Component API for extensibility

### Product Management
- Import/Export API
- Inventory synchronization
- Pricing and promotion engine

### User Management
- Authentication API
- User profile and preferences
- Permissions and roles

### Order Processing
- Order creation and management
- Payment processing
- Fulfillment tracking

## Technology Selection Criteria

For each technology integration, we will evaluate based on:

1. **Compatibility** with our existing architecture
2. **Performance** impact on overall system
3. **Developer Experience** and learning curve
4. **Community Support** and long-term viability
5. **Security** considerations
6. **Scalability** for growing needs
